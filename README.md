# ConvertPy

Automate Python-to-C++ code translation and native executable generation with the power of large language models (LLMs).

---

## 🚀 What is ConvertPy?

**ConvertPy** transforms Python code into native C++ executables using pretrained LLMs (like Gemini, Mistral, DeepSeek, and LLaMA). Eliminate the need for bloated bundlers or manual re-coding — just paste your Python code, select an LLM, and generate lightweight, platform-native binaries in minutes.  
Ideal for resource-constrained environments, rapid prototyping, and sustainable software deployment.

## 🎯 Who is ConvertPy for?

- Developers (beginner to intermediate) who want to deploy Python apps without packaging Python interpreters
- Students & researchers experimenting with LLMs and code translation
- Hackers and builders seeking fast, cross-platform executable generation
- Sustainability-focused engineers minimizing software bloat
